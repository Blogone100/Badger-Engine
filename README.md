Badger-Engine wants to be a 2D & 3D Game Engine written in Java. Right now the only part in development is the 2D one. The Physics Engine is made from scratch and so the Graphics one, which uses <a href="https://www.opengl.org/" target="_blank">OpenGL</a> with the help of <a href="https://lwjgl.org" target="_blank">LWJGL 3</a>. <a href="https://openal.org" target="_blank">OpenAL</a> is used from this library, too.

Right now the Engine is under development and this means that all the features described could be not implemented yet. Please check the <a href="#todo">TODO</a> list in the bottom of the page and don't hesitate to contact me if you want to know something.

## Current Version

The current version is <a href="https://github.com/LorenzoLeonardini/Badger-Engine/releases/tag/v0.3Beta" target="_blank">0.3Beta</a>. It mainly adds collision between moving circles. Still need to fix a bug that causes not moving circles to not really collide well. You can see the exact changelog <a href="https://github.com/LorenzoLeonardini/Badger-Engine/releases/tag/v0.3Beta" target="_blank">here</a>. Remember to follow the development on the <a href="https://github.com/LorenzoLeonardini/Badger-Engine/" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>.

## Requirements

This Engine uses <a href="https://www.opengl.org/" target="_blank">OpenGL 3</a>. Make sure your graphics card (and all your target cards) support it.

- Switching to OpenGL
